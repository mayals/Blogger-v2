    reetings and welcome to my blog! Codes City Blog , my name is May, and I come from an engineering and electronics background. Ever since I started using the internet, I have been captivated by the world of web development and its intricacies.
   </p>
   <p>
    The idea of simply being a user who browses websites and applications without understanding how they were created felt like a form of ignorance to me. I ended up considering questions like, "How are these applications fabricated?", "What processes do these pages go through before reaching us?" and "What are the foundational concepts behind them?".
</p>
<p>
    These inquiries just extended my advantage and drove me to examine any article or book that spoke about the subject. However, I soon discovered that the world of web development is complex and requires in-depth knowledge of various concepts and foundations. I realized that if I wanted my curiosity to be satisfied, I would need to commit to learning web development seriously and embark on the journey of creating web applications myself.
</p>
<p> 
    My love for learning web development grew, and I became particularly passionate about working with the backend framework, Django. 
</p>
<p>
    As I progressed in my knowledge, I found myself curious about how to consume the APIs I produced using Django Rest Framework. . This led me to learn the frontend framework, React , which helped me showcase my work on the frontend framework. 
</p>
<p>
    
    Now, on Codes City Blog, I am excited to share the experiences and knowledge I have gained during my web development journey with you. I aim to be a source of knowledge, someone who contributes to the web as much as they absorb from it. I hope to assist anyone who, like me, loves coding and is seeking a starting point.
    Feel free to explore the site and begin your own journey of web development.

</p>
<p>
    Happy Coding!
